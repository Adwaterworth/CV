	{\bf Problem Solving}& {Throughout the course of studying Physics at both undergraduate and postgraduate level I have had to solve both practical and theoretical problems frequently. Examples range from finding sources of experimental noise to developing software which rapidly re-analyses data with a new background subtraction.}\\ \\
	
	{\bf Adaptable}& {At the start of my Ph.D. it became apparent I needed to learn a programming language. I had minimal experience but, within a few weeks Python was my primary analysis tool.}\\ \\
	
	{\bf Team Player}& {Currently I am part of a team competing in an enterprising ideas competition where we must develop a business idea and pitch it to a panel of judges in February. We are working well as a group and on track to do well in the competition.}\\ \\
	
	{\bf Communication}& {In my Ph.D. I have presented at international conferences with Nobel laureates in attendance, as well as to non-physicists at outreach events. Through this I have learnt how to cater presentations to benefit the specific audience the most.}\\ \\
	
	{\bf Organisational Skills}& {In April 2016 I organised a Ph.D. conference within my university while continuing to make progress with my research. I relied heavily on my organisation skills and time management to keep everything on track.}

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Postgraduate Researcher}{September 2014 - Present}{Physics Dept. Royal Holloway, University of London}{Egham, Surrey}
{\small
\item[] I am working on a project studying 2D helium films at ultra-low temperatures.\\
My responsibilities include:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item[-] Managing the project
\item[-] Operation of a nuclear demagnetisation refrigerator pre-cooled by a `wet' dilution refrigerator.
\item[-] Design and construction of experimental apparatus, using AutoCAD Inventor.
\item[-] Analysis and data acquisition using Matlab, Python and Labview.
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Laboratory Demonstrator and Marker}{September 2014 - Present}{Physics Dept. Royal Holloway, University of London}{Egham, Surrey}
{\small
\item[] While studying for my Ph.D. I took on the extra responsibility within the department to demonstrate undergraduate labs and mark their weekly problem sheets.\\
This nurtured such skills as:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item[-] Time management, as I had to work this extra responsibility around my everyday research and keep to the schedule given by the course leader.
\item[-] Reliability, since it was the departmental policy to give feedback to undergraduates within two weeks of their submission. I always met this target in a timely fashion.
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Postgraduate Student Representative}{January 2016 - January 2018}{South East Physics Network (SEPnet)}{Egham, Surrey}
{\small
\item[] During my Ph.D. I was elected to represent the physics postgraduate students, from my institution, on the SEPnet student panel. I was responsible for gathering and providing feedback from students on events and courses run by SEPnet, as well as aiding in the production of the calendar for the events in the following year. \\
This gave me experience of:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item[-] Team leadership, as I often had to communicate conflicting opinions of the students to the panel and be decisive about what I thought was the best for them as a whole.
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Summer Student Researcher}{Summer 2013}
{Physics and Astronomy Dept. Liverpool University}{Liverpool, Merseyside}
{\small
\item[] I worked assisting a PDRA on a project relating to proton therapy.\\
During my time there:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] I showed good initiative by completing tasks with minimal supervision.
\item[-] I developed my communication skills by relaying my results back to the PDRA.
\end{itemize}
}
